# OpenGLProgram
First approach to openGL, using triangles, lights, textures and defining animations.

## Made with QtCreator
There is a make file easy to compile, and also a friendly user interface to help check all the things developed easily.
After `make` we should get a `esqueleto_qt` executable file.
